        <h2><strong>WHO AM I</strong></h2>
        <p>My name is Sean Lee, and my journey has taken me across different parts of the world, shaping who I am today. I was born in South Korea and, on June 22nd, 2007, I found myself beginning a lifelong adventure of learning and discovery. I’ve always believed that life is about embracing change, and my educational experiences reflect that.</p>
        <p>Throughout my childhood, I lived in various cities, each with its own unique culture and challenges. I attended several schools, each contributing something valuable to my growth. My early years of schooling were spent at YCIS in Shanghai, where I developed my foundation for learning and began exploring new interests. Later, I moved to SeokWoo in HwaSeong and then to BSN in Nanjing, where I dove deeper into my academic pursuits. But it wasn’t until I joined Harrow in Bangkok that I truly started refining my passions.</p>
        <p>Among the many things that have piqued my interest, computer science stands at the forefront. The problem-solving nature of coding, the intricate systems behind the screens, and the way technology shapes the world are endlessly fascinating to me. It’s no surprise that my free time is often spent immersed in games like Valorant and Overwatch, where strategy, teamwork, and adaptability come together – much like the real world of coding.</p>
        <p>But it's not just digital realms that grab my attention. I’ve always had a deep curiosity for the physical world, with physics and math driving me to understand the fundamental principles of nature. The beauty of how things work, from the most basic mechanics to the advanced concepts of nuclear and mechanical engineering, never ceases to amaze me. Add to that my interest in cutting-edge materials like meta materials, and you’ll understand that I’m someone constantly seeking to push the boundaries of knowledge.</p>
        <p>Of course, I am also passionate about basketball. It’s not just a sport for me – it’s about strategy, precision, and teamwork. Whether it’s in the game or the classroom, these are qualities that define me. History, too, plays a significant role in how I view the world. The lessons we learn from the past shape our present and future, and I enjoy delving into the stories that have brought us to where we are today.</p>
        <p>In essence, I am a person driven by curiosity, fueled by a love for knowledge, and always looking to learn something new. Whether it's through a textbook, a video game, or the court of a basketball game, I am constantly striving to understand, grow, and connect with the world around me.</p>
